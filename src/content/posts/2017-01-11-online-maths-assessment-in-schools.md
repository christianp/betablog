title: Online maths assessment in schools
---
I asked teachers what online maths assessment they do, and whether they put homework online.

## VLEs and assessment systems

* UT Austin made a system called [Quest](https://quest.cns.utexas.edu/)
* [Google Classroom](https://www.google.com/edu/products/productivity-tools/classroom) - all the google apps, plus some class and homework management.
* [Edmodo](https://www.edmodo.com/) - quizzes and static content. There's a thing to add content, but it looks like it's just web links - no score tracking.
* [MyMaths](https://www.mymaths.co.uk/) - lots of people saying they've stopped using it, but still have a subscription.
* [Mathswatch](http://mathswatch.co.uk/) - videos (in Flash!) with printable worksheets.
* [SIMS Learning Gateway](http://www.capita-sims.co.uk/products/sims-learning-gateway) - class management and homework tracking
* [INSIGHT](http://www.tascsoftware.co.uk/software-titles/insight-parental-engagement/) - share information between kids, teachers, and parents. Self-hosted, on an IIS server! 
* [Show my homework](https://www.showmyhomework.co.uk/) - multiple choice, spelling tests, or online submission of essays.
* [Frog](https://www.frogeducation.com/) - capture evidence and reporting.
* [ActiveLearn](https://www.pearsonactivelearn.com/) - similar to MyMathLab, with a more friendly UI.
* [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) - surprisingly, a couple of schools used Moodle. I think they're independent schools.
* [Mr H](http://singinghedgehog.co.uk/mindex.htm) has his own website with some worksheets (Excel format?!) and links
* [Showbie](https://www.showbie.com/) - each student needs an iPad; mark work by annotating PDFs
* [Go4Schools](https://www.go4schools.com/) - homework/attendance/behaviour tracking.
* [Hegartymaths](https://www.go4schools.com/) - videos with printable worksheets.
* [Office365](https://products.office.com/en-gb/academic/compare-office-365-education-plans) - I suppose they must just put word docs in a shared folder?
* [ClassCharts](https://www.classcharts.com/) - "seating planning and behaviour management", if that isn't too dystopian. Connects to SIMS
* [Mathspace](https://mathspace.co/) - it's that clever line-by-line marking thing! Does handwriting recognition, though the UI is a bit fiddly. Teacher claims kids get on with it fine anyway. A little bit slow - it sends off to a server for pretty much any op. Very impressive interface. Recommends activites adaptively. According to [Tim Stirrup](https://twitter.com/timstirrup, it's Â£5 per student per year.

## Conclusion

Pretty much everyone uses off-site hosted systems. I think only private schools have the wherewithal to run stuff locally.

No such thing as LTI - each system is self-contained, though [SIMS](http://www.capita-sims.co.uk/products/sims-learning-gateway) seems to let other tools feed into it.

Lesson plans and ready-made material are highly valuable. If teachers do make their own material, it's probably in an Office/Google Apps product.

Entering marks by hand doesn't raise any eyebrows. I suspect most of the tracking systems would accept an Excel file, though.

[Mathspace](https://mathspace.co/) looks like the only tool doing anything clever, of the sort we see in HE: adaptive learning, sophisticated automatic marking, very nice interface.

Many teachers reported subscribing to several products. Gives me hope that they could fairly easily try out something new, in addition to what they're already using.

## What we would need to offer

* We host it.
* Ready-made material.
* Good reporting - one of those tables of progress with a row for each student; excel export of marks.
